# Rental-Store-Application
This was a Java project I worked on in my Computer Science 2 class. (April 2022)

My main task was created the add(Rental s) method and its helper methods in the MyDoubleWithOutTailLinkedList class (a long name, I know). 

In this method, I programmed the application to add a Rental object in order by type (game or console), due date, and renter's name (respectively).
