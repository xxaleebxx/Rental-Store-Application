# Rental-Store-Application
This was a Java project I developed in my Computer Science 2 class. (April 2022)

My main task was to create the add(Rental s) method and its helper methods in the MyDoubleWithOutTailLinkedList class (a long name, I know). 

In this method, I programmed the application to add a Rental object in order by type (game or console), due date, and renter's name (respectively). 


**Notes:** Dowloading the files locally (or cloning the repository) would be needed to run the program with a compiler. More specifically, you would need to run the main function of the file GUIRentalStore.java. I used the built-in compiler of IntelliJ IDEA to do so.

This is a screenshot of how the program organizes and displays rental units (which are randomly generated in this case for testing purposes). If a user is renting a game and a console, or just a game, there will be a name of the game displayed. If the user is renting only a console, the column "name of the game" will be empty.

This screenshot diplays the box where a user can enter information to take out a new rental unit. After the user enters the information and selects "OK", the rental will be inserted into the preexisting list in the order of it's type, due date, and renter's name respectively.
